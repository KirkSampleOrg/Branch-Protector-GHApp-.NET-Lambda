# Branch Protector GitHub App for AWS Lambda in .NET 6

A solution for automating the protection of the default branch in newly-created GitHub repos. The solution is built in .NET 6 and configured to run in an AWS Lambda function using the Lambda Function URL feature to expose it over HTTP. This solution enables organizations to automatically apply branch protection rules to the default branch, and if a new repo was created without a default branch, a ReadMe.md file is automatically created in the repo in order to create the branch.

### This readme file will contain the documentation and instructions for deploying the solution
